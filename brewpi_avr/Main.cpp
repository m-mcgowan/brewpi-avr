/*
 * This Atmel Studio 6 project automatically includes all needed Arduino source files, you just have to point it to the right directories.
 * To compile this project on your computer, you will have to set an environment variable to find your local Arduino installation.
 * Set the variable ARDUINO_HOME to point to your local Arduino path, without trailing slash, e.g. 'D:\arduino-1.01'. Instructions on the wiki here:
 * http://wiki.brewpi.com/index.php/Setting_up_the_brewpi-avr_Project
 * 'ArduinoFunctions.cpp' includes all the source files from Arduino that are used. You might have to edit it if you are not using a Leonardo.
 * That is all that is needed! No hassle with makefiles and compiling libraries.
